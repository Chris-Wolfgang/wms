.SYNOPSIS
    Creates custom GitHub labels for the repository.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses the GitHub CLI (gh) to create labels used by Dependabot and
    other workflows. Run this locally once after creating a new repo from the template.
    
    Labels created (existing ones are updated to the canonical colour and description):
    - bug, needs-triage        — applied by the bug-report issue form
    - enhancement, feature-request — applied by the feature-request issue form
    - dependencies             (blue)   — applied automatically by Dependabot to every update PR
    - no-changelog             (yellow) — waives the changelog-fragment PR check for src/ changes with no user-visible effect
    - maintenance              (steel)  — kind label, applied to the per-repo parent Maintenance issue
    - maintenance-task         (steel)  — kind label, applied to every Maintenance sub-issue
    - maintenance - security   (red)    — category: scans, finding fixes, dependency vuln audit
    - maintenance - performance (green) — category: profile, benchmark, optimize, validate
    - maintenance - testing    (gold)   — category: coverage, integration/smoke/mutation tests
    - maintenance - cleanup    (brown)  — category: refactor for reuse / quality / efficiency
    - maintenance - docs       (blue)   — category: XML docs, README, CHANGELOG, samples
    - maintenance - API        (orange) — category: public/internal surface audit
    - maintenance - CI/CD      (pink)   — category: Docker, CI workflow, build/publish pipeline

.PARAMETER Repository
    The repository in owner/repo format. If not provided, uses the current repository.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Setup-Labels.ps1
    Creates the labels for the current repository

.EXAMPLE
    .\Setup-Labels.ps1 -Repository "Chris-Wolfgang/my-repo"
    Creates the labels for a specific repository

.NOTES
    Requires: GitHub CLI (gh) authenticated with sufficient permissions
    Install gh: https://cli.github.com/
