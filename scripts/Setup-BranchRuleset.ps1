.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a branch protection ruleset for the main branch in the current repository.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses the GitHub CLI (gh) to create a repository ruleset that protects
    the main branch with pull request requirements, required status checks, security
    scanning rules, and automatic Copilot code review.
    Run this locally after creating a new repo from the template.
    
    The script will prompt you to choose between single-developer or multi-developer 
    repository settings:
    - Single Developer: No PR approvals required (you can merge your own PRs)
    - Multi-Developer: Requires 1+ approval and code owner review
    
    The ruleset includes:
    - Pull request reviews with configurable approval requirements
    - Required status checks (tests, security scans)
    - Force push and deletion protection

.PARAMETER Repository
    The repository in owner/repo format. If not provided, uses the current repository.

.PARAMETER BranchName
    The branch to protect. Default is "main".

.PARAMETER RequireLinearHistory
    Also add the "required_linear_history" rule and restrict merges to squash and rebase (no merge
    commits). Satisfies baseline item 9. Stacked PRs then need scripts/restack.ps1 after each merge —
    see docs/STACKED-PRS.md. Off by default so existing repositories keep merge commits.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Setup-BranchRuleset.ps1
    Creates the ruleset for the current repository with interactive prompts

.EXAMPLE
    .\Setup-BranchRuleset.ps1 -Repository "Chris-Wolfgang/my-repo"
    Creates the ruleset for a specific repository

.NOTES
    Requires: GitHub CLI (gh) authenticated with sufficient permissions
    Install gh: https://cli.github.com/
    
    Required Permissions:
    - Admin access to the repository, OR
    - Write access with "Administration" permission enabled
    
    These permissions are necessary to create and modify repository rulesets.
