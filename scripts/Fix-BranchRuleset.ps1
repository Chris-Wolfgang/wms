.SYNOPSIS
    Replaces the branch ruleset: creates a fresh "Protect main branch" with Setup-BranchRuleset.ps1
    and deletes the previous one only after that succeeds (other active rulesets are disabled).

.DESCRIPTION
    Use it when the canonical ruleset changed upstream (a required check was renamed or added) and
    the repository's ruleset is stuck on the old definition. The script inspects the repository's
    rulesets, disables any other ruleset that is still active (left in place, disabled, for
    inspection), renames "Protect main branch" aside WITHOUT disabling it, runs
    Setup-BranchRuleset.ps1 to create the fresh ruleset, and only then deletes the old one. If the
    creation fails the old ruleset is renamed back, so main is never left unprotected. It does not
    patch rules in place.

    The script presents a plan of all changes before executing and prompts for confirmation.

.PARAMETER Repository
    The repository in owner/repo format. If not provided, uses the current repository.

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed automatically. Alias: -y

.PARAMETER RequireLinearHistory
    Forwarded to Setup-BranchRuleset.ps1 when the ruleset is recreated (adds the
    required_linear_history rule and limits merges to squash/rebase).

.EXAMPLE
    .\Fix-BranchRuleset.ps1
    Inspects and fixes rulesets for the current repository with interactive confirmation

.EXAMPLE
    .\Fix-BranchRuleset.ps1 -Force
    Inspects and fixes rulesets without prompting for confirmation

.EXAMPLE
    .\Fix-BranchRuleset.ps1 -Repository "Chris-Wolfgang/my-repo"
    Inspects and fixes rulesets for a specific repository
